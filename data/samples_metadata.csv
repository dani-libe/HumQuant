The steady increase in prices is attributed to shortage of raw materials in the country and increased prices in the international market. Current prices are up to 30 percent above quarter 1 2020 prices. • Rice prices have also been increasing steadily from the second half of 2020 to early part of 2021, driven by draw down in stock levels. Shortfall in production due to severe flooding in June/July 2020 and low import volumes contributed to tight supplies amidst increased demand, pushing prices up. • Although rice prices stabilized in March, they remain elevated and up to 60 percent above Q1 2020 prices. While more imports are expected, prices are unlikely to come down significantly until mid-2021, when Boro harvest is expected to reach the market. • Red lentil prices remained fairly stable from mid-2020, thanks to adequacy in stock levels through imports.

Much of the country’s cropland lies in the north-east, north and central parts of the country, including notably the governorates of Al-Hasakeh, Ar-Raqqa, Aleppo, Hama, Homs, and Rural Damascus. Agriculture in the western governorates of Lattakia, Tartous and Idleb is known to largely centre on citrus fruits, apples, olives and vegetable cultivation. While the Badia region, a stretch of semi-arid land in central Syria covering around 55 percent of the country, is primarily used for livestock grazing.While Syria cultivates a number of crops; namely barley, cotton, tobacco, sugar beet, lentils, chickpeas, fava beans, peas, vegetables, citrus fruits, olives and herbs, its main staple is wheat. Up to 40 percent of wheat grain is cultivated in Al-Hasakeh governorate, with Ar-Raqqa, Aleppo, Hama and Homs governorates contributing much of the remaining 60 percent. Some wheat is also cultivated in Rural Damascus governorate and in the southern governorates of Dar’a and Quneitra and in the irrigated land of Deir-ez-Zor governorate. As a result, much of the wheat trade flow goes from northeast and northern parts of the country towards western and southern Syria. Syria is currently a wheat deficit country, meaning it does not produce enough wheat annually to meet its own needs. In 2019, wheat production was 2.2 million tonnes, below the estimated total utilization requirement of 4.5 million tonnes (of which 3.5 million tonnes is for food use) and below the 4.1 million tonnes pre-crisis (2002-11) national average production level. In 2020, it is estimated that wheat production in Syria will be around 2.8 million tonnes with only around 0.8 million tonnes produced in GoS controlled areas.Syria heavily depends on markets for its food security.

An analysis based on household surveys estimated that, even with the current emergency transfers, the poverty rate in Colombia by May had increased from 18 to 32% and extreme poverty from 4.5% to 16.7%, as a consequence of the loss of labor income to over four million informal workers (Sánchez and Chaparro, 2020).176 Scholars, civil society actors and politicians have widely called for a more far- reaching and sufficient basic income. In June, legislators proposed a bill for a three-month universal basic income to reach nine million households, but the bill did not make it to a vote and as a result, dozens of politicians signed an open letter to the President calling for this basic income, highlighting 5.4 million jobs lost during the crisis and an increase in poverty. In response, the Minister of Finance declared that the government had already established nearly a universal basic income with its existing programs, and that the resources the government had “do not enable us to provide a minimum income to nine million households”.177 At the end of June, the government declared that it had extended the monthly transfer of 240 000 pesos per households in the IS program through to the end of the year.",['Livelihoods'],CO

While the government announced assistance relatively rapidly −before the end of March− and added transfers as the quarantine was extended -the way it determined recipients had a negative impact on reach. One report identified 1.9 million poor and vulnerable households that just missed the threshold for eligibility, but are in need of government assistance (Cárdenas and Martínez, 2020). Government officials have pointed to important achievements with the Sisbén database; for example, through receiving the IS transfer, 740 000 people now have bank accounts. However, problems with the database have slowed down the ability of the government to reach even all the intended recipients, let alone those in need of assistance who were not included: by the end of June, 600,000 people had still not been reached, for a variety of reasons, driving officials to go find the individuals in person at their homes, rather than through electronic means.178 

The government was as of early July 2020 seeking to update and improve the database. At least part of the problem appears to be that prior to the pandemic, people had been hesitant to register updates in the Sisbén database due to fear of disqualifying for means-tested assistance.179 However, as of the end of July there was no way for a person to self-identify and apply for the IS transfer assistance.180 The only way for a person in need to be considered for inclusion was to apply to be evaluated for the Sisbén database, which requires a visit to the Sisbén municipal office and a request for an interview. The interviewer then goes to the applicant’s home at an agreed-up time to conduct the interview.181 Such a mechanism is unlikely to be fast or feasible during a pandemic-induced quarantine. Given the small amount of the transfer, and the pre-determined and restrictive reach, the program to date is neither inclusive nor sufficient. 

Cities in Colombia have moved to fill in some of the gaps in national assistance. Bogotá provided additional cash and in-kind assistance to poor and vulnerable households, with the goal of enabling a family of four to meet their basic necessities during the quarantine. Such aid reached 337,000 households by late May, but here also the government determined the beneficiaries.182 Medellín, on the other hand, created a mechanism by which people could themselves determine if they needed assistance, and electronically apply for aid.183 By mid-April, 130 000 households had registered for and received aid this way, many of them not registered in any other government programs, and by mid- May, 300,000 households had received aid.

The consequences of the Global Gag Rule are also being felt. This US policy, officially known as the Mexico City Policy, cuts off US funding for programs outside of the US that provide abortion-related services, including counseling and informing women about their reproductive choices. About 68 percent of the total resources allocated in 2019 to the Venezuelan migration crisis in Colombia came from the US and, as a result of this policy, many organizations have curtailed abortion-related services to avoid losing vital US funding, reduced sexual and reproductive health services due to lack of access to funds from other sources, or have been forced shut down altogether. MSF is responding to high demand for these services, including safe abortion care. In MSF projects in the border departments, for example, approximately one in five consultations is related to this issue. But much more needs to be done to address the needs.

The organisation plundered villages and bombed markets and churches, as well as mosques it deemed “infidel”. In April 2014 it staged the kidnapping of 276 schoolgirls in Chibok, Borno state.

A week later, on March 27th, the bonus was formalized in an executive decree. It provided two US$ 60 transfers, for April and May, to 400 000 households affiliated with two government registries (rural social security and unpaid domestic work) and with a household income below minimum wage. Households that received any other government transfers (for example, the human development bonus) were ineligible.186 The government pre-selected the recipients, and began distribution of these transfers on April 1st. Eligible individuals could check online to see if they were recipients but could not apply for it.

This expansion was financed by the Inter- American Development Bank.

Ongoing conflict and political and economic instability have negatively affected families’ livelihoods and their ability to meet basic needs. The August 2017 FAO Agriculture and Livelihoods Assessment shows that farming, livestock and fisheries have suffered with production declining due to insecurity, high costs, and limited access to or lack of agricultural inputs (seed, livestock vaccines & drugs, fertilizers, farm tools, animal feed, machinery rents, and fuel for irrigation pumps). According to the FAO assessment report, livestock health has degenerated considerably due to lack of vaccines, drugs and veterinary services as a whole (including surveillance) which could lead to outbreak and spread of zoonotic diseases. The fisheries sub-sector is also facing a major challenge due to the suspension by the government in 2011 to support fisher folk. This coupled with high cost of fishing equipment has greatly affected the only income source and livelihoods of small scale fishers. Many IDPs, returnees and refugees often struggle to meet their food consumption needs as access to essential household commodities, including food, has been significantly reduced as the conflict has disrupted own production and market functionality, creating financial instability and lack of cash as well as skyrocketing food prices; as a result, the majority of households (75 per cent) who are market-dependent have low purchasing power and have resorted to negative coping mechanisms such as cutting meals, reducing number of meals per day, among others.

The apparent reduction of new HIV cases is most likely due to the shortage of HIV tests that has limited the capacity of the health system in detecting new cases.6 The number of tuberculosis (TB) cases by 2017, according to preliminary data, was 10,185 which represents an increase of 41% compared to what was reported in 2014 (6,063 cases). There was an incidence rate of 32.4 per 100,000 inhabitants, the highest in more than 40 years. This increase was concentrated in males between 15 and 34 years of age, the most economically active population. Almost 25 per cent of all cases were concentrated in two vulnerable groups: people in prisons (15.7%) and indigenous groups (6.8%). Between 2014 and 2017 the number of drug-resistant cases doubled (from 39 to 79 cases). The TB/HIV co-infection in 2017 was 4.8% and the association of TB and Diabetes was 5% of the total, with a clear increased trend. The mortality rate of TB patients is constantly at 2.2 per 100,000 inhabitants since 2009.7 Furthermore, more than 30% of the population suffer from Non-Communicable Diseases (NCD), such as cancer, diabetes, hypertension, chronic respiratory diseases, etc. The majority are currently not receiving adequate treatment and proper follow up. Most Venezuelans suffer a certain degree of malnutrition; Caritas Venezuela indicated in 2018 that approximately 280,000 children are at risk of death due to the shortage of food, 50% of children present different stages of malnutrition, and the severe status, reported in hospitals, has increased from 2% to 14%. Due to the context, there is a lack of medical staff and disruption to electricity in the Popular Power Ministry for Health (MPPS), which has negatively impacted the capacity for providing adequate services to the general population. The lack of medicines, commodities and supplies affects the diagnostic capacities of laboratories and radiological facilities. Spare parts of medical equipment and absence of regular maintenance are additional problems that health facilities are facing within the country and represent the main obstacles for providing a proper and quality treatment and care in the Venezuelan Red Cross’s health facilities.",['WASH' 'Health'],VE

The scarcity and low quality of water is common throughout the country, and authorities are implementing an alternate distribution of the water supply depending on local capacities. A lack of maintenance to the water and sewage systems has resulted in poor quality water supplies, multiple malfunctions and inconsistent repairs in areas that have remained without water for more than 15 continuous days on occasions. Currently, the population is struggling to cope with this complicated situation. Some households have purchased water tanks and are buying water from private trucks, but many other communities do not have this financial capacity. The low level of water potability makes safe consumption of this water almost impossible. In fact, there has been an increased number of water-borne diseases, such as the recent outbreak of hepatitis A, mainly in the states of Capital District, Falcón, Zulia and Apure. The lack of sanitation has generated a scenario with multiple diseases in the population, such as intestinal and skin infections among others.

Originally, the Migration Act established that migrants with final convictions for serious crimes that amounted to three years of custody could be subject to exclusion from entry or deportation. With the adoption of the DNU 70/2017, exclusions and deportations now extend to migrants with any custodial criminal record, no matter how many years of conviction the crime amounts to. Additionally, it allows for the deportation of migrants whose convictions are not final, violating the principle of presumption of innocence. The deportation procedure introduced by the DNU 70/2017 shortens the timeframe and can be applied to any foreigner without properly taking into consideration his/her particular circumstance. Under this new procedure, whether the person has family or roots in the country does not prevent the National Migration Office from carrying out the deportations4. Once the deportation order is issued, the new timeframe gives the person only three days to challenge the administrative decision, and, if this challenge is rejected, only three more days to dispute the rejection in court. The reduction of the timeframe –which was originally of fifteen days– directly impacts on the capacity of migrants to exercise their right to appeal. In addition, the State has now no obligation to provide free legal aid. Instead, the person has to ask for a public defense lawyer and must prove the lack of economic means –all of that within the three-day timeframe. The DNU 70/2017 also removed the guarantee that the Migration Act had introduced allowing administrative decisions to be subject to review when there had been errors, omissions or manifest arbitrariness, violations to due process or when new solid facts justified the revision5. The way in which this ruling was introduced was also problematic, leading to the DNU 70/2017 being deemed unconstitutional in March 20176. The Executive challenged this decision and since 2018 the case awaits consideration by the National Supreme Court. Meanwhile, the DNU 70/2017 is still being applied and continues to reinforce a false paradigm that links migration to crime. Since the adoption of the DNU, deportation procedures have alarmed increased7 while programs dedicated to facilitating the regularization of migrants have been cancelled8 and a complex new digital system combined with expensive fees are creating many barriers for the access to regularization9.",['Protection'],AR

These effects become more pressing and therefore more urgent to prevent and remedy in the case of children, where the damage caused by separation can become irreparable. As a result, the international duty of the States to grant special protection to children is especially relevant. In spite of this, the DNU 70/2017 introduced a restriction to the family unity criterion that, as an exemption, may allow a person to remain in the country despite having a deportation order issued against him/her20. With this a, family unit has become an exception to deportation orders at the sole discretion of the National Migrations Office. This decision can -and should- be revised by the Judiciary when appealed by migrants. However, in many cases of appealed deportation orders involving family separation documented by Amnesty International and other local organizations (see Appendix), the Judiciary has limited itself to confirm the National Migration Office’s discretion to decide whether or not to apply the family unit criterion as an exemption to deportation. In this regard, the Committee on the Rights of the Child has recently taken a stance on how the regulatory changes introduced can impact on family unity and the best interest of the children: “The Committee is concerned about the continued application of the DNU 70/2017, despite it being deemed unconstitutional, and its potential negative impact on family unity and the best interests of migrant children. The Committee urges the State party to repeal DNU 70/2017 in order to ensure that, in migration cases, the right of a child to have his or her best interests taken as a primary consideration is upheld, while family unity is preserved.”21 By curtailing the analysis of the rights to family unity and reunification to the exclusive and discretionary evaluation of the Executive branch, the State is violating its obligations to comprehensively assess each situation on a case-by-case basis and with due consideration of the rights and interests at stake. The cases described in the Appendix are not extensive, but are dramatic examples that serve to illustrate how the State’s shift in its migration policy is separating families and causing irreversible harm on children.",['Protection'],AR

Plataforma de Coordinación para Refugiados y Migrantes de Venezuela,"d) Access to justice In FGD sessions, both Venezuelan and Guyanese women indicated not reporting incidents of violence and criminality to the police for a variety of reasons. These include a lack of trust in the police in Guyana, language barriers, and the perception that police will request payment of approximately 20,000 Guyanese dollars (96USD) per incident. When asked about submitting reports on GBV incidents, Venezuelan women mentioned that these are not reported to the police as, allegedly, the police fails to conduct impartial criminal investigations against Venezuelans. They added that they also fear to be questioned, detained and deported, or to be subjected to retaliation by perpetrators of GBV. Additionally, information was shared in some of the FGD on serious criminal incidents allegedly committed by Guyanese policemen against Venezuelan women. In Port Kaituma, the police reported receiving no reports of incidents of sexual violence, but mostly reports on cell phone theft by Venezuelans. The police station currently has two (2) female police officers to assist in addressing any reports made by Venezuelan women. According to the police officer in charge, there are some officers in the station who are able to understand Spanish. He added that it is not required to have an identity card or a temporary stay permit to report GBV incidents. He said that once the report is done, the survivor is escorted to the hospital to have a physical examination and receive proper treatment. The doctor has the obligation to report to the police if an incident of sexual violence has occurred. He could not confirm if Post Exposure Preventive (PEP) kits and psychosocial support are available at the hospital. Probation officers stationed within the region provide some limited amount of psycho-social support; however, there are no psychologist or psycho- social services available in Port Kaituma. He mentioned that hospitals in Georgetown have better capacity to respond to incidents of sexual violence. In Mabaruma, there are perceptions within the police that Venezuelans have started to create a negative impact on Mabaruma and its neighboring communities. Concerns were expressed about Venezuelans not blending into the host community, involvement in a small number of petty larcenies and sex work. The number of assaults has increased as well as the number of Venezuelans arriving on a daily basis, according to the police inspector. The language barrier and the constant flow of Venezuelans coming and going are a challenge for the police in adequately taking reports of GBV. The police inspector noted that no reports of GBV involving Venezuelans have been received",['Health' 'Protection'],GY

Plataforma de Coordinación para Refugiados y Migrantes de Venezuela,"iii. Children In FGDs in Bartica and Port Kaituma, it was shared that Venezuelan children have on occasion been bullied in schools based on their nationality. They are also discriminated by Guyanese children when they do not have the resources to pay for the school uniforms, shoes, etc. Authorities in Port Kaituma expressed their concerns about an increasing number of children that are not enrolled in schools. The local authorities in Bartica mentioned that a total of 15 students of secondary school age have been assisted by the Government of Guyana with uniforms, school meals, books and transportation. Efforts are being made to conduct an assessment to obtain statistical data on the number of children not currently enrolled in school and to ensure that they too are assisted. Authorities are also in the process of constructing a new facility in Itaren Bam to house these new students and to reduce the cost of rent. According to information provided by the Senior School Welfare Officer from the Ministry of Education in Mabaruma, there are currently 108 Venezuelan children enrolled in schools in the Mabaruma area: 46 at Mabaruma Primary School; 36 at Wauna Primary School; and 26 at Whitewater Primary School. Of these numbers 45 are males enrolled and 63 are females enrolled. The language barrier has created a challenge in responding to any psycho-social support needs of Venezuelan students. Identified potential cases requiring support are being referred to the Welfare Officer. The education sector in this area has had no reported cases of GBV involving Venezuelan students. However, cases of GBV involving children of the host community are known to be occurring but are not being reported. If the incident is reported such cases are very difficult to prosecute due to challenges in locating GBV survivors and perpetrators. Cases of pregnancies among girls as young as 12 years have been reported. There were reports shared at the FGDs of Venezuelan adolescent girls between 16 and 17 years old being victims of trafficking in persons in bars and brothels in Guyana, particularly in the mining areas. These adolescents usually travel alone and use fake identification cards to enter Guyana. Some children have been seen begging and involved in child labor in the towns and also in the mines. Incidents of parents mistreating their children and forcing them to work were shared in the FGD in Port Kaituma. However, no formal reports have been made to the Child Care Protection Officer in this location. There were reports also of incidents of sexual violence against Venezuelan girls and the various challenges faced by the parents in reporting these incidents to the police and having the alleged perpetrators brought to justice.",['Health' 'Education' 'Protection' 'Livelihoods'],GY

Plataforma de Coordinación para Refugiados y Migrantes de Venezuela,"g) Other at-risk groups i. Indigenous (Warao) During the GBV rapid assessment, information was shared on the movement of members, particularly families, of the Warao Indigenous Group from Venezuela to Guyana. Some of these families are being hosted by the Warao community in Mabaruma. Some other Warao families are staying in temporary shelters; like the one at the dock in Mabaruma were some Warao families were identified. The Warao has been known as “the boat people” in view of their lifelong and intimate connection to the water. The Warao continue to arrive in Marabuma and other territories in Guyana. Approximately 1,000 Warao indigenous community members have arrived in Mabaruma as Venezuela's crisis deepened. They use canoes as their way of transportation from Venezuela to Guyana. Some of them still travel regularly between the two countries (pendular movement) while others arrived in Guyana with their families seeking mainly food and protection. Some Warao speak Spanish but the majority can only communicate in the Warao language. Regardless of Spanish-language skills, language remains a significant barrier in Guyana as they are unable to communicate in English. According to the local government in Mabaruma, Warao indigenous group members who have arrived in Guyana have been provided with food, clothing and farming tools. Although some have been offered parcels of land for settlement, many are still living in poor conditions, while others have not been vaccinated since their arrival (over 4 months ago). It was reported that the Warao are highly exposed to labor exploitation in Guyana as well as to survival sex and human trafficking.",['Health' 'Protection' 'Shelter' 'Cross' 'Livelihoods' 'Food Security'],GY

Plataforma de Coordinación para Refugiados y Migrantes de Venezuela,"a) Access to health care Health care is free of charge in hospitals in Guyana, regardless of the migratory status that the person has and is accessible to everyone without discrimination or prejudice. If Venezuelan women go to a clinic or a private doctor then services are provided for a fee. Medicines are also provided for free in hospitals; however, if the medicines are not available in the hospitals, patients must buy them from pharmacies. Services are also available to Warao indigenous community members whenever they need to. Data collection of persons accessing health care services is not disaggregated by nationality, but only by age and gender. No information campaigns in Spanish on available health services, health care and sexual and reproductive health (SRH) have taken place. Most of the participants in the FGDs expressed interest in receiving information on SRH, including prevention and treatment of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STI). Similarly, the Ministry of Indigenous People´s Affairs in Marabuma expressed the need for information dissemination and community sensitization programmes with the members of the Warao indigenous community on the same topics. Some authorities in the locations visited as part of the rapid GBV assessment, believe that the healthcare system is overburdened due to the influx of Venezuelans and returning Guyanese. Authorities in Mabaruma believe that the presence of Venezuelans brings health and security risks, especially those engaged in survival sex and those temporarily staying at the dock without proper shelter, cooking and WASH facilities. They are using the same dark waters for drinking, cooking and bathing. Lack of potable water is a major problem for residents. According to information collected throughout the rapid GBV assessment, pregnant women are not accessing medical services on a regular basis, mainly due to lack of information that services are free of charge and fear of detention when they do not have their temporary resident permit. Other Venezuelan women mentioned that they do not approach the services because social workers in health facilities treat them as criminals and discriminate against those engaged in survival sex. In Port Kaituma, there is one hospital and the two doctors mentioned an increase in the Venezuelan presence about one and a half years ago. There, Venezuelans access free of cost health services and one female doctor is able to communicate with them in Spanish. An average of 15 Venezuelan women present themselves to the health centers weekly. The services that are usually accessed include vaccinations upon arrival to Port Kaituma, labor and delivery, and malaria treatment. Incidence of diarrhea and tuberculosis is rising. Currently the health facility knows of two confirmed cases of multidrug resistant tuberculosis. They facility has received requests for STI testing and they have noticed an increase in demand for condoms. They also reported a number of cases of vaginal infection. Birth control is available but currently they do not have implants. In Port Kaituma, the hospital does not offer surgical or pediatric services. It was also mentioned that information campaigns on available health services and sexual and reproductive health (SRH) in Spanish have not taken place in the location. IEC materials at the hospital are not available in Spanish. Insufficient medical supplies to meet the needs of the host community and the Venezuelans is an ongoing challange. The hospital has seen cases of GBV, including among Venezuelans. According to the local authorities, counselling sessions were previously conducted and condoms previously distributed under an IOM HIV-AIDS project that targeted high risk segments of the population. Such initiatives are no longer operational at Port Kaituma.",['Health' 'Protection' 'Livelihoods'],GY

Plataforma de Coordinación para Refugiados y Migrantes de Venezuela,"b) Access to psychosocial support In terms of mental health and psychosocial support, there are limited options available to Venezuelans arriving in Guyana. The Mental Health Department of the Ministry of Health in Georgetown was established three years ago. According to the Head of the Department, services are being provided to mainly Guyanese, including those returning from Venezuela. The main types of cases identified in adults in the regions are depression, psychosis, dementia, epilepsy, substance abuse, stress related disorders while children/adolescents present with mild disorders. One of the challenges is that most of the staff working in the health facilities speak only English. However, some Guyanese doctors that studied in Cuba or Cuban doctors working in Guyana are able to assist some of the Venezuelans in Georgetown. In terms of psychologists and psychiatrists, there are also limitations in the language with very few psychologists in Georgetown that speak Spanish. In 2018, in collaboration with World Health Organization (WHO), training on psychosocial support was provided to more than 300 staff, doctors, nurses and social workers. Some of them were from Mabaruma in Region 1 and speak English and Amerindian languages fluently; however, none of them are fluent in Spanish. As for Region 7, there is no personnel trained on psychosocial support. In Port Kaituma, the hospital does not provide any kind of mental health and psychosocial support services.",['Health'],GY

Plataforma de Coordinación para Refugiados y Migrantes de Venezuela,"a) Survival sex As per the accounts shared by participants and key informants, the main concentration of Venezuelan women in the country is around the mining areas. In these locations, Venezuelan women are working in shops, cleaning services, bars, hotels, and nightclubs. In Georgetown, Venezuelan women mentioned on several occasions that some of the main barriers for them to have access to formal economic opportunities were the language and lack of professional references in Guyana. Therefore, most of the Venezuelan women and even the Guyanese returnees end up working in places where they are most likely to be exploited, verbally and physically abused by either their employers or co- workers. Some Venezuelan women end up working in bars and having sex with clients in exchange for money. This situation extends to region 7 and 1, where many women resort to survival sex, not because they want to, but because there is no other option to help their families in Venezuela. As one participant stated: “No woman wants to do sex work, we do it because we are forced to and we have no other option”. In Port Kaituma, women shared that they started working in sex work after arriving to this town and facing difficulties communicating in Spanish and finding a well paid job that could allow them to cover their living expenses and to send money or goods to their families in Venezuela who depend on them. Many stated that they were professionals in their country and had a decent life in Venezuela and that their families do not know what they are doing in Guyana.",['Protection' 'Livelihoods'],GY

Plataforma de Coordinación para Refugiados y Migrantes de Venezuela,") Access to livelihoods Venezuelans reported in the FGDs and KII that they work more hours and receive less salaries than the Guyanese. Some returning Guyanese complained about the labor conditions they have encountered since their return from Venezuela. According to them, they work more than 8 hours, are not allowed to take any breaks, and are paid G$1,050 (5USD) per day. In Port Kaituma and Mabaruma some Venezuelan women are living with their families and work in shops or were looking for a job. Some women have experienced sexual harassment in the workplace by their employers. They touch them, say obscene things to them and ask for sexual favors. Some try to find another job elsewhere. One of the Venezuelan participants working in a shop mentioned that she asked her employer to increase the daily wages, instead, the employer asked for sexual favors. She then had to find another job. The fact that most Venezuelans speak only Spanish and lack professional references in Guyana combined with the fact that their qualifications may not be recognized has been a barrier for them to finding decent work and reporting any incidents to the local police. Therefore, many Venezuelans and even Guyanese returnees end up working in places where they are more likely to be exploited or verbally and physically abused by employers or co-workers. In general, participants in the FGD mentioned that the cost of living in Guyana is very high compared to the minimum wage, for example the minimum wage is G$42,022 (200 US dollars) and the cost of rent/month is around G$63,033 (300 US dollars). At least 3 out of 5 men in Bartica were self-employed or worked at a restaurant or in a mine. Many are underpaid or work minimum hours per week so their salaries are insufficient to maintain themselves while in Bartica, thus making it impossible to maintain their families in Venezuela. In Mabaruma, Venezuelan men are also taken to the mines to work there; however, they said that they are being exploited; working many hours and getting paid less than the offer received or sometimes they are not even paid for their hard work. They are also told that they need to stay one month and half in the mines before they can leave. According to them, Venezuelans are not aware of their labor rights and do not know where to seek assistance. This is causing a lot of distress to the Venezuelans. Another issue mentioned was not being allowed to have access to bank accounts from local banks. As a result, instead of saving towards a better future, men are forced to spend more with the intention of future resale or save in unsecure locations. Venezuelan men expressed their interest in obtaining residence permits in order to be able to access formal economic activities and avoid being exploited at work. They would also like to obtain certification in desired courses.",['Protection' 'Cross' 'Livelihoods'],GY

Libya reported its first COVID-19 case on March 24th. As of April 13th, there are 26 recorded cases of COVID-19 in Libya out of some 535 tests that have been conducted. Given that testing is limited, it is likely that the reported number of cases is a conservative estimate. Moreover, the escalating conflict, particularly in Tripoli and along the western coast, is impeding the country’s ability to respond to COVID-19 cases. Understanding the specific needs, perceptions and experiences of people on the move in relation to COVID-19 can inform the work of humanitarian actors, particularly those in health and livelihood programming, seeking to assist refugees and migrants in Libya.",['Health'],LY
