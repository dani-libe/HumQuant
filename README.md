The annotations, along with their source texts, are under "data/annotations\_and\_sources.zip". You should unzip this file in the "data" directory.
The annotations_and_sources folder contains the annotations and the raw excerpts and is structured in this way:
  * annotation:
    There is one folder per excerpt containing a subfolder with the annotations made by a specific annotator. The annotations are stored in the .xmi file (readable using the dkpro-cassis module of Python or via INCEpTION).
      
  * source:
    There are all the source documents (one for each excerpt). These are the input files used during the evaluation step.
